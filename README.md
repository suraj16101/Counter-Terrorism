# Counter Terrorism using Density Based Clustering and Naive Bayes Classification

### Abstract

The most important global issues currently are pollution, unemployment, corruption, drugs, terrorism and climate change. Terrorism is a serious issue throughout the world causing fear, anxiety, insecurity, violence and death among innocent people. This makes national security an important issue and steps need to be taken to combat terrorism. It is further used as a tool for a political cause. In this analysis, Density-Based clustering is used to obtain clusters through Rapid Miner tool. The clusters are used to find patterns of terrorist attacks in India and inferences from these attacks. Naive Bayes Classification is also used to predict probable attacks in the future.
